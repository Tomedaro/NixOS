# Home Manager ownership

The repository is migrating from a single-user `home-manager.sharedModules`
transport model to explicit user-owned Home Manager composition.

## Ownership layers

- `modules/core/users.nix` owns NixOS/Home Manager integration, NixOS user
  creation, integration policy (`useGlobalPkgs`, `useUserPackages`, backup
  behavior), and the transitional single-user assertion.
- `hosts/Singularity/default.nix` owns the concrete `daniil@Singularity` Home
  Manager installation compatibility baseline (`home.stateVersion = "26.05"`).
- `users/daniil/default.nix` is the reusable Home Manager entrypoint for Daniil.
  It is a `homeManager`-class module and deliberately does not set
  `home.stateVersion`, username, UID, or home directory.

Pinned Home Manager's NixOS integration derives username, UID (when defined),
and home directory from the corresponding NixOS user.

## Transitional rule

54 feature/host modules still contribute through `home-manager.sharedModules`.
This remains safe only because `modules/core/users.nix` asserts exactly one
managed Home Manager user. Migrate those feature payloads incrementally rather
than replacing all of them in one patch.

Do not use `osConfig` or `home-manager.extraSpecialArgs` as a universal escape
hatch. A user module should depend on NixOS state only when the user behavior is
genuinely a function of system configuration.
